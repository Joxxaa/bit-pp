    <dd>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, 
        compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop 
        (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing 
        the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, 
        when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, 
        two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with 
        the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</dd>

    <dd>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football 
        normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association 
        football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); 
        Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent 
        common origins and are known as football codes.</dd>
